# Personal Task Manager

This project is a personal task manager developed in **React**, with three main features:

- **Add Task:** Allows adding a new task to the list.  
- **View Tasks:** Displays all registered tasks.  
- **Advice of the Day:** When clicked, the app fetches a random piece of advice from an external API.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **HTML5 and CSS3**  
- **External API** for fetching advice (https://api.adviceslip.com/advice)

---

## Prerequisites

- **npm** for package management

## Notes
